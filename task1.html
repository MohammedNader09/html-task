    <h1>Petra</h1>

    <p>
        Petra is an ancient city in southern Jordan, famous for its buildings carved directly into rose-colored rock cliffs. It was the capital of the Nabataean Kingdom around the 4th century BCE and became a major trading center for goods like spices and silk. The most iconic site in Petra is Al-Khazneh, also known as The Treasury, which is reached through a narrow canyon called the Siq. Petra was later taken over by the Romans and eventually abandoned after several earthquakes. It was rediscovered in 1812 by a Swiss explorer. Today, Petra is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the New Seven Wonders of the World.
